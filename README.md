# xACARS
This is still in early development, expect issues! If you find issues, create a new issue [here.](https://github.com/slimit75/xACARS/issues)

ACARS system for phpVMS, powered by PythonÂ®.

xACARS currently supports FSX, P3D (untested, but should work anyways), and X-Plane. It also currently only supports Windows.
